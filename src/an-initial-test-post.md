# An initial test post

Hello! No time to write a proper post right now, but I wanted to make sure that the blog was working. I'll be back soon with something good. I promise.

In the meantime. Here's some [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

Thanks for reading!

Josh.
