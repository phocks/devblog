been learning Rust for a while now.\nThe other day I came across this little project called Gleam. It's a functional programming language. It's written in Rust. It compiles to JavaScript and Erlang. It borrows a lot of the good bits from Rust while hiding away a lot of the lower-level stuff.  It feels kinda like Rust-lite.\nI was intrigued, so I took a quick look into it.\nIf you're also intrigued I recommend taking the Gleam language tour, or keep reading for a quick speedrun.\nGleam is easy to install via Homebrew or your system package manager.\nNew projects can be made with gleam new my_project.\nPackages can be added with gleam add. Let's add gleam_otp with gleam add gleam_otp, which we'll use to spawn new tasks. It will now be an entry in your gleam.toml file, under [dependencies]\n\nI'm interested in Gleam's concurrency handling, so let's test it out. Add the following code to src/my_project.gleam (an example from the Gleam homepage).\n\nCompile and run the code with gleam run.\nYou should see a whole bunch of hellos from different numbers. They appear, at first glance, to be counting in order from 0 to 200,000 like this.\n\nThe cool thing is though, that each of these tasks is being run concurrently (if you've got a multi-core processor that is ... I think) ...\n... And if you scroll back up, you should see that some of the numbers are actually out of order.

Let's write an extremely simple commandline application that does this!\nWe already know how to print stuff to the console, so all we need is a random string generator library. There's a crate I've used before called nanoid, which might do the trick.\nUse your existing Hello World project or create a new one with cargo new.\n\nWe add the crate using the cargo add command.\n\nThis will add the latest version of nanoid to your Cargo.toml file.\n\nWe can now use the nanoid crate directly in our code, using :: to access the nanoid! macro inside the crate.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the use keyword to bring the macro into scope. Then we don't have to use the fully qualified name with the double colon syntax :: every time we want to use it.\n\nThat's our app anyway. Run it with cargo run and we'll get a random string of text printed to the console. But it might be fun to actually install it on our system so we can run it any time we want.\nTo do this simply run cargo install --path . in the root of your project. This will install the app in ~/.cargo/bin, which should have been added to your PATH when you installed Rust. You can now run it from anywhere on your system.\nIn my case, I called the app rando so now whenever I want a random string of text printed to the console I can just run rando and hey presto I get that random string of text.\nTo uninstall the app just run cargo uninstall rando.\nThat's it for today.

It all went fine, but then the sound was back again. I'd completely wiped it from my memory, the huge saga that I went through when I first got the board. The chipset runs real hot, and the fan runs real loud.\nI'd fixed it before, so now I'm just writing it up for next time, or for anyone else who's having the same issue. I make no guarantees that you won't brick your motherboard, but I've done this twice now and it's been fine.\nStep 1: Enable ASPM.\nUsing information from this Reddit post, follow the steps below:\n\nDownload this boot file: bootx64.efi\nFAT32 format a USB drive and create a folder /efi/boot.\nPut the file in the boot folder.\nRestart your PC and boot from the USB drive from your BIOS.\nYou will get a GRUB screen and a command prompt.\nType setup_var 170 37 and press enter.\nPower off and restart Windows.\nCheck HWiNFO64 and search for ASPM settings.\nIt should say L1 Entry instead of disabled.\n\nTo reset back to default:\n\nDo the same kind of thing until you get to the GRUB cli.\ntype setup_var 170 00 and press enter.\nReboot.\n\nStep 2: Tweak the fan curve.\nUsing instructions from this Reddit post, follow these steps:\n\nDownload modGRUBShell.efi and put it in /efi/boot on your USB drive.\nDelete bootx64.efi and rename modGRUBShell.efi to bootx64.efi.

This sets the fan curve to 80 degrees, which means it will wait until the chipset is 80 degrees before it starts ramping up the fan speed. (You can also try 0x55 for the final value to set it to 85 degrees).\nReboot and you should be golden.\n\nNote: Use LibreHardwareMonitor to get the real chipset temperature and fan speed.\nThat's it.

In order to get silky smooth fading between two complex SVGs, I needed to make sure work was being offloaded to the GPU.\nIn modern browsers (although some filter properties are now supported) basically only opacity and transform are GPU accelerated. So we can transition between multiple layers using opacity.\nHere's the basic idea. First we have two SVGs.\n\nThen we layer the SVGs on top of each other using CSS and animate the top layer's opacity.\n\nAnd there you have it! A GPU accelerated transition between two SVGs.

All up, I've paid zero dollars to keep it running. I've had a few people ask me to write up something about it, so here it is.\nIf you're comfortable logging into a Linux server via SSH and running commands you shouldn't have any major troubles setting it up, but it will take a few hours of work. Enjoy!\nFirstly though, why would anyone even want to run their own Mastodon instance? Well, for the fun of mucking around with servers and software, perhaps? Maybe for the freedom to post whatever you want on your own platform and no dumb billionaire can suspend you or force you to take it down? Who knows? Anyway...\nTo run a Mastodon instance you need 2 things.\n\nA domain, or subdomain.\nA server, 2GB RAM minimum. 50GB disk space minimum.\n\nGetting a proper domain name for free is more art than science these days, especially since Freenom shut down new registrations. Here are some other places to try.\n\nnic.eu.org - They make you jump through a few hoops, plus it can take up to a month or two (or forever) to get approved.\nnic.ua - pp.ua domain. 1-year registrations only, but you can renew manually for free each year.\n\n(If you know of any other places to get free domains, please let me know.)\nYou can also use a subdomain. Subdomains are easier to get for free. Try some of these places or do a search online.\n\nafraid.org\nGitHub free-subdomain topic\nnoip.com\nduckdns.org\n\nOr else, if you already own a domain name, you can create a subdomain like mastodon.yourdomain.com or fedi.yourdomain.com or whatever you like.\nNow you need a server to point your domain to.\nYou could use any old computer that you have lying around the house, or you could sign up for the free tier on the Oracle Cloud. This is what I'm using currently.\nGoogle Cloud also offers a free server, but they only give you 30GB storage and 1GB of outbound traffic and Mastodon will chew through this pretty quick. But you could try GoToSocial, Pleroma, or Akkoma instead, which are a bit more lightweight.\n(If anyone knows any other free-forever tier VPSs please let me know too.)\nI wrote up this little guide a while ago about how to get 2x Oracle Cloud servers free forever. These are x86 servers with 1GB RAM each. 1GB is a bit small for a Mastodon instance, but I can confirm that it does run if you enable some swap space and don't enable Elastic Search. You could even try splitting the database and the web server between the two separate servers, if you're feeling adventurous.\nGood news though. Oracle has now added ARM servers to their free tier. These are the Ampere A1 Compute servers. You can create from 1 up to 4 servers with 24GB of RAM spread between them, which is more than enough for a Mastodon instance. And they're free forever too. I am running mine on a 2-thread ARM CPU with 12GB RAM and 50GB block storage.\nOracle gives you up to 200GB of block storage, which you can spread across all your servers. I have had some issues with running low on disk space and having to set up scripts to compress media etc (see below), so I'd probably recommend using 100GB for your Mastodon instance as a minimum. Unfortunately, Mastodon uses a lot of space for storing accounts and media etc. You can hook up object storage later if you want, but it's not necessary for starters.\nOK, so now you have your domain and you have it pointed to the IP address of your server (or your home IP address with ports 80 and 443 forwarded to your internal address). Now you need to install Mastodon. Simply follow the instructions over at the official guide to get started. There are quite a few steps involved, but it's not too hard if you take it one step at a time.\nIf everything went well, you should now have a working Mastodon instance. Log in and start posting!\n\nps.\nHere are some scripts that I run on cron every few hours, mostly to help keep disk usage down.\nThis first one runs tootctl to prune old accounts and media etc. This may not be necessary these days as I believe Mastodon has some built-in pruning now. But I've been running this for a while and it seems to work.\n\nThis compresses images in the cache. You'll need to install jpegoptim and pngquant for this to work.\n\nAaaaaaaand... there you have it. Contact me on Mastodon at @josh if you have any questions or need any help, or if you just wanna say hi 👋\n\npps.\nI forgot to mention, the only other thing that you kinda might need during the install is an SMTP service for sending emails for sign-ups. I'm pretty sure it's not 100% necessary for a single-user instance, because the installation will set up an admin account for you and you can also use the Mastodon cli tools to create accounts without email confirmation.\nBut if you want to be able to send emails, you can use Mailgun for free. You can also try SendGrid, but I believe they require you to verify your identity with a credit card.\nYou can also try setting up SMTP through Gmail, as suggested by KuJoe.\nHappy days!\n\nppps.\nThanks to @futzle for pointing out that if you don't want literal Nazis and 4chan-like trolls posting the worst stuff on the Internet at you (I found out the hard way), you should probably import a blocklist to block the worst of the worst instances in the fediverse. Here's a good one here called FediNuke. You can import the text file in admin settings under Moderation -&gt; Federation.\n\nUPDATE 2024-03-03: Unfortunately Oracle's free-tier services locked me out of my account without warning, with no way to contact a human for support :(\nThe steps above will still work, but I would recommend you run your Mastodon instance on your own hardware in-house, or try Google's free tier (though it probably won't have enough storage — maybe try GoToSocial), otherwise (and yes this is not free forever but hey whatever) try to find a cheap VPS on LowEndBox.\nI'm now running an instance on my own hardware at home.\nGood luck out there!\n\nIf you found this useful, please consider buying me a coffee, as unfortunately coffee isn't free 🥲 ☕\n","id":"https://josh.is-cool.dev/running-a-mastodon-instance-entirely-free-forever/","title":"Running a Mastodon instance entirely free forever"},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/running-runes-locally-with-svelte-5-pre-release-alpha/":{"body":"I noticed Svelte published some v5 pre-releases.

That's it.\nWe can use assert! to check if something is true (it will cause the function to panic if the expression is false).\nHere's a test that passes.\n\nAnd here's a test that fails.\n\nWe can also use assert_eq! to check if two things are equal.\n\nAnd we can use assert_ne! to check if two things are not equal.\n\nWe can put these tests anywhere and cargo test will run them all. It's common however to put all your tests inside a tests module at the bottom of the file. Annotate this module with #[cfg(test)].\n\nWhy would we want to do this?\nWell, putting tests in a module like this allows us to encapsulate code and any helper functions or libraries we might need for our tests and make sure they don't end up in our final binary.\nFor simple test functions that don't bring in other code, it's not strictly necessary. You could even put the tests inline right after the functions you're testing.\nHere are some tests in action.\n\nWell, there you go. Now you can write tests to make sure a function actually does what you want it to do. Super easy and ... kinda fun!\nThere's a little bit more to testing in Rust and you can read about it in the Rust Book. Here's a breakdown of some other stuff to think about.\n\n#[should_panic] - put this under #[test] if you actually want the test to panic (useful for testing error handling).\n#[ignore] - put this under #[test] to ignore the test unless you run cargo test -- --ignored (useful for tests that take a long time to run).\nIntegration tests - put tests as separate files in the tests/ directory if you're making a library and want to test how it integrates with other code.\nCustom failure messages - use assert!(1 == 2, \"1 does not equal 2\") to provide a custom failure message. ie. additional arguments to assert! will be passed to format! and used as the failure message.\nResult&lt;(), String&gt; - instead of panicking, you can use Result&lt;(), String&gt; as the return type for your test function and the test will pass if the result is Ok(()) and fail if the result is Err(String).\nuse cargo test -- --nocapture to see the output of println! if your tests pass.\nchoose which tests to run with cargo test it_works or cargo test it_works2.\n\nThat's it for now. Good luck out there you beautiful evolving Rustaceans! Go write some amazing tests!\n🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀\n","id":"https://josh.is-cool.dev/test-early-test-often/","title":"Test early test often: writing tests in Rust is super easy and (kinda) fun!"},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/using-steps-for-performant-css-transitions/":{"body":"I've used a lot of CSS transitions over the years. Shifting between values in a smooth fashion is pretty easy with a simple one-liner.\n\nBut what if you have a lot of transitions? What if you have too many transitions? Your browser tries to run them as fast as your monitor's refresh rate allows (60 times per second, or more). This can be pretty taxing.\nRecently I ran into this problem transitioning many elements of a large SVG with a bunch of complex shapes. With all the elements transitioning all at once, the page scrolling started to stutter quite noticeably.\nHere's how I solved it. Instead of a transition, I used CSS animations, with steps() to effectively \"bring down the frame rate\" and stop the browser from doing too much work.\n\nOr you can use the shorthand.\n\nJust add the do-transition class to the element you want to animate. Adjust the animation-duration and the steps() count to get a balance between smoothness and performance.\n\nHere's a little demo with a simple SVG. I've kept the steps() low to make the effect more noticeable.\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\nThat's the basic idea anyway. I hope it helps if you run into a similar problem.\n(Bonus tip: Use animation-delay to stagger the animations if you have a lot of elements transitioning at once so they don't all paint on the screen at once on each step())\nHappy coding! 🚀\n","id":"https://josh.is-cool.dev/using-steps-for-performant-css-transitions/","title":"Using steps() for performant CSS transitions"},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/what-cargo-new-gives-you/":{"body":"Last time we used cargo new to generate a new Rust app. Let's take a look inside.\nRun tree to print the directory structure.\n\nThere's also a hidden dotfile .gitignore and the .git folder, but don't worry about those for now.\nThe Cargo.lock file is generated by Cargo by cargo run and it's for dependency tracking and that's Cargo's problem.\nThe two important files are Cargo.toml and src/main.rs.\n\nCargo.toml is our project's manifest, where we keep track of stuff about the project in TOML format and also any dependencies we want to use. Currently there's none!\nName and version are pretty self-explanatory. The edition key is for specifying which edition of Rust we want to use ie. latest stable edition, 2021.\nThe src/main.rs file is our entry point.\n\nWhen compiling, Rust will look for the src/main.rs file with a main function inside. Functions in Rust are defined with the fn keyword.\nIf Rust finds a src/lib.rs file it will build a \"library\", which can be used as a dependency inside another app instead of a standalone binary app. (We can also have both apparently. But we'll get to that later.)\nTo print \"Hello, world!\" to the console we use the println! macro, which is built-in to Rust. Macros are kinda like functions that expand into other functions at compile time. They have a ! at the end. For now, you just need to know that println!() prints stuff to the console.\nAaaaaand that's just about it. Let's edit some code. We can make the computer say whatever we want!\n\nDo another cargo run and give us a little happy dance.\nNice.

I noticed however that afterwards my internet connection would inexplicably slow to a crawl whenever I connected. Disconnect, and it would be fine again. Connect, and again, virtually nothing — especially if sound was playing through the headset.\nThe easy solution was to connect my WiFi on the 5 Ghz band. Done. It worked. No interference. And that could have been that. But it was still bugging me. I still wanted to know why. I still wanted to fix it.\n(2.4 Ghz gets better range than 5 Ghz because it's a lower frequency so sometimes it actually gives me a more stable connection from further away.)\nI found a few possible solutions. I tried changing the WiFi channel on my router, and that helped a little bit, but not quite enough.\nIn the Arch Wiki they have a small section about Intel combined WiFi and Bluetooth cards and playing with the coexistence setting and I thought I was onto something.\nThey suggested adding the following to /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf:\n\nBut nope. Nothing. No difference.\nAfter some searching, a post in the Arch Forums put me on the right track.\nIn the end, adding this to /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf fixed it for me:\n\nReboot and you're all good.\nSeems to be the same fix as described here, but for a different symptom.\nAnyway, hope this helps someone else. Happy hacking!\n\nps.\n\nJim Mussared put me on to this page about iwlwifi and platform noise which gives a bit more information about why this works.\n\n","id":"https://josh.is-cool.dev/wifi-and-bluetooth-can-coexist/","title":"WiFi and Bluetooth can coexist peacefully on 2.4 Ghz"}},"docInfo":{"https://josh.is-cool.dev/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/a-brief-interlude-into-gleam-concurrency/":{"body":201,"title":4},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/a-custom-mastodon-favicon-while-you-wait/":{"body":72,"title":4},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/a-static-site-with-zola/":{"body":181,"title":3},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/a-trip-to-the-library-in-rust/":{"body":184,"title":3},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/about/":{"body":55,"title":0},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/an-initial-test-post/":{"body":25,"title":3},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/archive/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/asus-rog-strix-you-need-to-calm-down/":{"body":272,"title":11},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/compiling-the-zed-code-editor-on-linux/":{"body":123,"title":5},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/dark-web-for-dummies/":{"body":74,"title":3},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/in-browser-wasm-we-trust/":{"body":184,"title":3},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/installing-umami-analytics/":{"body":66,"title":3},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/nature-keeps-evolving-rustaceans/":{"body":37,"title":4},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/offloading-svg-transitions-to-the-gpu-using-layers/":{"body":135,"title":6},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/one-does-indeed-simply-install-arch-linux/":{"body":91,"title":6},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/running-a-mastodon-instance-entirely-free-forever/":{"body":615,"title":6},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/running-runes-locally-with-svelte-5-pre-release-alpha/":{"body":145,"title":8},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/svelte-state-sharing-just-use-classes-theyre-fine/":{"body":44,"title":7},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/switching-filesystems-in-arch-linux/":{"body":233,"title":4},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/test-early-test-often/":{"body":291,"title":10},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/using-steps-for-performant-css-transitions/":{"body":132,"title":5},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/what-cargo-new-gives-you/":{"body":157,"title":3},"https://josh.is-cool.dev/wifi-and-bluetooth-can-coexist/":{"body":153,"title":6}},"length":25},"lang":"English"}
