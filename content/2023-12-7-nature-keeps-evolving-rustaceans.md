You can't fight nature.

We're learning Rust OK? Evolution time. Let's gooooo!

First up, [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

That will give you `rustc` and `cargo` and `rustup` and other stuff.

Let's make a new project and scuttle into the directory.

```bash
cargo new hello
cd hello
```

Run the project.

```bash
cargo run
```

You just ran your first Hello World program in Rust.

Crab party time! ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€ğŸ¦€
