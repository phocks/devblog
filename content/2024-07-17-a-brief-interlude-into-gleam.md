I've been learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/ "The Rust programming language website") for a while now.

The other day I came across this little project called [Gleam](https://gleam.run/ "The Gleam programming language website"). It's a functional programming language. It's written in Rust. It compiles to JavaScript and Erlang. It borrows a lot of the good bits from Rust while hiding away a lot of the lower-level stuff.  It feels kinda like Rust-lite.

I was intrigued, so I took a quick look into it.

If you're intrigued too I recommend taking the [Gleam language tour](https://tour.gleam.run/ "The Gleam language tour"), or keep reading for a quick speedrun.

First, [install Gleam](https://gleam.run/getting-started/installing/ "Installation instruction for Gleam and Erlang etc.") via Homebrew or your package manager.
